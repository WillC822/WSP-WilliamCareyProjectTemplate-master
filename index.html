		<p>Will here! This will make close to 8 months that I've been working with coding and I must say there are many challenges that I wasn't expecting to face. I am still learning and as many in the field will tell you and the only way to learn is to practice. I am here to show you the elements I plan on working with to make myself better in this world wide web of developers and designers, hopefully solidfying a place to stand amongst them!</p>

		<h1>Component Library</h1>
		<!-- 1st Compontent - Nav bar -->
		<article>
			<img src="images/NavMenuwDropDown.PNG" alt=" " >
			<h2>Nav Bar w drop down</h2>
			<p>Navigation Bars and having them either inline or as drop down menu's have proven difficult. I hope to spend some time this month learning a little more about them.</p>
			
			<h3>How does this relate to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
			<p>Having the navigation bar allows a user to quickly choose a category and with the use of a drop down all subcategories are hidden until needed which helps to take up less space on the page.</p>

			<h3>How might I build this?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create the component as a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
				<li>Create Navigation <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> containing a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with four <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> each containting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. </li>
				<li>Dropdown menu items will be nested <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>inside of corresponding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Style Guide</h3>

		<!-- 2nd Compontent - Background Images -->
		<article>
			<img src="images/GradientImage.PNG" alt=" ">
			<h2>Background Image - Different Gradients and Transperancy</h2>
			<p>Background Images have proven difficult to lock in on also. I am particularly fond of the backgrounds that are transperent enough where you can layer them accordingly to add a sense of design. I would like to learn more about this styling element as I go along this month.</p>

			<h3>How does this relate to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
			<p>Being able to change gradients and transperancy with backgrounds allows for much more customization and different options to make a website more individualized. </p>

			<h3>How might I build this?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create the component as a <code>&lt;body&gt;</code></li>
				<li>Create CSS that targets the specific<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> then add the background-image selector as an url . </li>
				<li>Set the background-repeat to no-repeat or repeat-x.</li>
				<li>Set the background-attachment to fixed.</li>
				<li>Laslty you would want to set the opacity to a value less than one 0.5.</li>

			</ol>
			<p></p>

			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/55387.html" target="_blank">View Example</a></li>

			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="components/2/component.html" target="_blank">View Component</a></li>
			</ul>

		<!-- 3rd Compontent - Blocked Components with Buttons -->
		<article>
			<img src="images/BlockedButtons.PNG" alt=" ">
			<h2>Blocked Components with button</h2>
			<p>In some cases these are also referred to as testimonials and I would like to learn more about proper shaping and spacing with ability to add additional information that is hidden until the user clicks on it requiring additional information.</p>

			<h3>How does this relate to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
			<p>Having this option, plays into the convenience of allowing a user to only have to go to one place to access the answers that they may require.</p>

			<h3>How might I build this?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a section with a specific id tag.</li>
				<li>Create div class for all items that will be blocked and arrange accordingly adding a tag class and href as a button</li>
				<li>In CSS link original section id and display as inline-block</li>
				<li>Linking to div class create border radius, border, width to make design look appealing</li>
				<li>In CSS link original section id and display as inline-block</li>
			</ol>
			<p></p>

			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/55693.html" target="_blank">View Example</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="components/3/component.html" target="_blank">View Component</a></li>
			</ul>

		<!-- 4th Compontent - Responsive List -->
		<article>
			<img src="images/ResponsiveList.PNG" alt=" ">
			<h2>Responsive List</h2>
			<p>I have had issues with creating websites that are fully responsive and I would like to be able to add responsiveness to different elements as the need for mobile is ever present and a requirement in most fully functional websites.</p>

			<h3>How does this relate to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
			<p>Having responsitivty in a page allows a site to be able to be viewed on mostly any platform that is available to consumers. Having this option ensures that the information will be available to anyone regardless of the platform they use to access the information.</p>

			<h3>How might I build this?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create div class for all items that will be responsive</li>
				<li>In CSS use @ media queries to set the screen dimensions and make adjustments accordingly.</li>
				<li>Style responsive elements at each break point</li>
			</ol>
			<p></p>

			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/demo/55684.html" target="_blank">View Eaxmple</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="components/4/component.html" target="_blank">View Component</a></li>
			</ul>

		<!-- 5th Compontent - Sticky Footer w Map -->
		<article>
			<img src="images/StickyFooter.PNG" alt=" ">
			<h2>Sticky Footer w/map</h2>
			<p>Having contact information readily available is very beneficial for a business or owner. It allows the consumer to have the information at a glance instead of having to search on the page. I've had problems with this in the past but will do my diligence this month to get better. </p>

			<h3>How does this relate to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
			<p>With using a map in the footer you gain the option of providing users with more information at a glance. By also linking the map using jquery one might be able to get directions from wherever they are, which will also play into usability.</p>

			<h3>How might I build this?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create the component as two<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> both inside <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
				<li>Create div class of wrapper containing a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with four <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> each containting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. </li>
				<li>Add src with map images</li>
				<li>Add CSS to wrapper and styling for other elements</li>
			</ol>
			<p></p>

			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/joomla-templates/55709.html" target="_blank">View Example</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="components/5/component.html" target="_blank">View Component</a></li>
			</ul>
