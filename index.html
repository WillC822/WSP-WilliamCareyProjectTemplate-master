		<p>Will here! This will make close to 8 months that I've been working with coding and I must say there are many challenges that I wasn't expecting to face. I am still learning and as many in the field will tell you and the only way to learn is to practice. I am here to show you the elements I plan on working with to make myself better in this world wide web of developers and designers, hopefully solidfying a place to stand amongst them!</p>

		<h1>Component Library</h1>
		<!-- 1st Compontent - Nav bar -->
		<article>
			<h2>Nav Bar w drop down</h2>
			<p>Navigation Bars and having them either inline or as drop down menu's have proven difficult. I hope to spend some time this month learning a little more about them.</p>
			
			<h3>How does this relate to what I have/will learn in WDD?</h3>
			<p>Having the navigation bar allows a user to quickly choose a category and with the use of a drop down all subcategories are hidden until needed which helps to take up less space on the page.</p>

			<h3>How might I build this?</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create the component as a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
				<li>Create Navigation <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> containing a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> with four <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> each containting an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. </li>
				<li>Dropdown menu items will be nested <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>inside of corresponding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p></p>

			<ul class="buttons">
				<li><a href="components/1/OfficeforRent.html" target="_blank">View Component</a></li>
			</ul>

		<!-- 2nd Compontent - Background Images -->
		<article>
			<h2>Background Image - Different Gradients and Transperancy</h2>
			<p>Background Images have proven difficult to lock in on also. I am particularly fond of the backgrounds that are transperent enough where you can layer them accordingly to add a sense of design. I would like to learn more about this styling element as I go along this month.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- 3rd Compontent - Blocked Components with Buttons -->
		<article>
			<h2>Blocked Components with button</h2>
			<p>In some cases these are also referred to as testimonials and I would like to learn more about proper shaping and spacing with ability to add additional information that is hidden until the user clicks on it requiring additional information.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- 4th Compontent - Responsive List -->
		<article>
			<h2>Responsive List</h2>
			<p>I have had issues with creating websites that are fully responsive and I would like to be able to add responsiveness to different elements as the need for mobile is ever present and a requirement in most fully functional websites.</p>
		</article>

		<!-- 5th Compontent -  -->
		<article>
			<h2>Sticky Footer w/map</h2>
			<p>Having contact information readily available is very beneficial for a business or owner. It allows the consumer to have the information at a glance instead of having to search on the page. I've had problems with this in the past but will do my diligence this month to get better. </p>
